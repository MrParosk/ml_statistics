    "- Ordinary Monte Carlo can be used to compute many complex integrals, provided the function is known. Expectation and probability on intervals are special cases (integrals).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong law of large numbers guarantees the convergence while the central limit theorem provides conﬁdence intervals.\n",
