# bayesian_mlThis repo contains notebooks about various topics in bayesian machine Learning. The topics are:-  Bayesian inference - using Bayes rule to derive posterior distributions and predictive posterior distributions.- Monte carlo methods - use monte carlo methods (Hastings Metropolis and Gibbs sampling) to approximate posterior distributions.- Variational inference - use variational inference to approximate posterior distributions.- EM algorithm - use the EM algorithm to find maximum likelihood estimations of model parameters.
